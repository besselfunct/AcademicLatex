# Article Template

This directory contains an article template which enables the following functionality in Overleaf:
- Supporting Information is compiled as a separate document which can be referenced in the main text
- The Response to Reviewers can be compiled as a separate document that refrences line numbers, page numbers, and labels from the main text
- The Cover Letter can be compiled as a separate document in the same directory
