    We have a label on page \pageref{point:1} line \lineref{line:1} which we can reference using pageref and lineref respectively.
    Unfortunately, the \verb|xr| package does not play nicely with the \verb|hyperref| package, so if you want hyperlinks, you will have to compile separately with the package enabled/disabled.
