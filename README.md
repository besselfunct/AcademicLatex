# AcademicLatex

This repository attempts to contain several useful LaTeX tips and tricks that may be useful for the academic writer.
It is not comprehensive, nor does it try to be, but there are many things that I have personally found useful in here.

## Directory Structure
There are 4 main directories in this repository.
Each directory contains a `.zip` file which can be uploaded to Overleaf, and the contents of that `.zip` file so that you can see the code easily.

- The `HomeworkTemplate` directory contains a basic explanation of how to use the `exam` class to automate a significant amount of work in the creation of homework and exams, and highlights several benefits to constructing homework/exams in LaTeX.
- The `ThesisTemplate` directory contains the official UIUC thesis template which was released in 2021 without any modification.
- The `UsefulPackages` directory contains a simple document which goes through several packages that may or may not be useful to scientific writers, and has some basic code snippets detailing their use.
- The `ArticleTemplate` directory demonstrates several useful automations for preparing publications, and providing a response to reviewers.
In particular it shows how to set up the working directory on overleaf so that:
  1. Supporting Information is compiled as a separate file, but can be referenced in the main text
  1. The response to reviewers is compiled as a separate file, but can reference figures, page numbers, and line numbers from the main text
  1. The cover letter can be compiled as a separate file from the same directory
- This [tool](https://flamingtempura.github.io/bibtex-tidy/index.html) is extremely useful for linting bibliographies, and catching duplicates. 

TODO:
- Add example references to `Article Template`
